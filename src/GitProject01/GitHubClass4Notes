----------------------------------------------

Tracking our first project using Git:
**-->Create a new project in Intellij and in order to start tracking it follow the
following steps:

Step -->1.The first step find the location of your project.(in intellij the path is
written in front of project name,you can also right click
on project name and the click on open in explorer.
Step -->2.Decide the location where you want to create your project.(Please do not create a repo
within a repo)
Step -->3 Navigate your terminal to the location of your project.

Initializing(starting)the repo:
Step 1--> On Git bash.
->pwd(Find the locator)
-->git init

******3-Stage architecture:--->Git has three Stage architecture and they are:
1-Working Directory.
2-Staging Area
3-Repo
Working directory--->:all the files that you have in your project
Staging area-->:An area between repo and working directory,here the snapshot
of all the files are moved before actually moving them to repo.
-->Repo:Our actual storage are.

Step 2-->git status command
-tells the status of repo,
-and the untracked files
-files that are in staging are but not in repo yet!
-It does not tell us about files in staging area  which are also in repo!
-untracked files appeared RED color
-tracked -->the files  in staging area are appearing in Green color
